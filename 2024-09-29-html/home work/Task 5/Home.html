      Don't be afraid of the big word Programming language lets understand what
      its is together.
      <br />
      A programming language is a formal set of instructions that enables humans
      to communicate with computers and create software applications. It
      consists of syntax, semantics, and rules that define how code is written
      and executed. Different programming languages, such as Python, Java, and
      JavaScript, are designed for various purposes, ranging from web
      development to data analysis and artificial intelligence. Each language
      has its own strengths and weaknesses, allowing developers to choose the
      most suitable one based on the task at hand. Overall, programming
      languages serve as essential tools that empower developers to bring their
      ideas to life through code.
