      Let's learn about HTML.
      <br />

      HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used
      for creating and structuring content on the web. It serves as the backbone
      of web pages, allowing developers to define elements such as headings,
      paragraphs, links, images, and multimedia. By using a series of tags and
      attributes, HTML organizes content in a hierarchical manner, making it
      easy for browsers to interpret and display. As a foundational technology
      alongside CSS and JavaScript, HTML enables the creation of interactive and
      visually appealing websites. Its simplicity and flexibility make it an
      essential skill for anyone interested in web development or digital
      content creation.
