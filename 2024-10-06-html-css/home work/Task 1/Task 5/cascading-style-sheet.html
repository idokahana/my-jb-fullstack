      It's time to CSS there is the information.
      <br />
      CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to control
      the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows developers to
      apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to web
      elements, enabling the separation of content from design. With CSS, you
      can create visually appealing websites that are responsive and adaptable
      to different screen sizes. The language offers various features, including
      selectors, properties, and media queries, which empower designers to
      achieve complex designs while maintaining consistency across multiple
      pages. By utilizing CSS, developers can enhance user experience and
      improve the overall aesthetic of web applications, making it an
      indispensable tool in modern web development.
